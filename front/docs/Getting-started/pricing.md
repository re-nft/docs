# Pricing

## Protocol fee

The reNFT protocol is currently free because we want to stimulate adoption as much as possible. 

The future fee will be a percentage fee per transaction. The revenue will be shared with the integrated project. The total fee will be determined by the integrated project and the reNFT DAO.

reNFT is operating as a DAO, therefore we can propose different revenue split options between the integrated project and reNFT. If, for example, your project has a lot of rental volume, we can propose to change the split in favor of your project.

We prefer to stake the revenue that we receive from your project back into your ecosystem.

## Implementation costs

The implementation should be so easy that you don’t need help from us, but we’re more than happy to help! There will be no implementation costs involved.
